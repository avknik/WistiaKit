/**
    `WistiaPlayer` presents a convenient facade in front of `AVPlayer` for working with your Wistia hosted video.

    Create a `WistiaPlayer` with a `WistiaMedia`, or the `hashedID` of one, and it will play the best
    asset for the device and current configuration.

    Use the `WistiaPlayerDelegate` as a convenient mechanism to respond to key events
    in the video playback lifecycle.

    - Important: Render the video by presenting the `AVPlayerLayer` vended by `newPlayerLayer()`.  If you
    want this handled for you, including playback controls, see `WistiaPlayerViewController` or use
    a standard `AVPlayerViewController` via `WistiaPlayer.configureWithUnderlyingPlayer(_:)`.
 
    Spherical, 360°, binocular, or any other kind of video that needs to be presented in a non-flat way is
    not specially hanlded by `WistiaPlayer`.  Use the `WistiaPlayerViewController` to properly present these media types.

    - Note: The underlying `AVPlayer` is not exposed to facilitate the proper collection and reporting
    of important Wistia statistics.  Common functionality of the `AVPLayer` is available through
    public API directly on `WistiaPlayer` and through the delegate callbacks.
